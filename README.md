Hello there! This project is a wordpress/Medium inspired project.
I started this as a means of improving and honing my coding skills. Recolon is a content-driven platform for developers. Similar to what Medium does.
This is still a test website and not fully ready yet. As there are some features not developed yet. If you come across this project and find some interest in it, leave a star and get in touch. Remember to always switch to the test branch. It is the most recent build of the app. I would also like to add that at the time of creating this project, there are some programming techniques employed that may not be best practices. This was simply to test what I learnt about nodeJs and it's ecosystem. Thank you
